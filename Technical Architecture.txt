# Sahayak Video Generation Architecture

## System Components
- **Orchestration Layer**: Coordinates the entire generation pipeline
- **Frame Generator**: Creates sequential image frames (1800 frames for 60s video)
- **Audio Synthesizer**: Generates educational narration
- **Video Assembler**: Combines frames and audio with FFmpeg

## Data Flow
1. User request → API endpoint
2. Content analysis → Educational script generation
3. Parallel processing:
   - Image sequence generation (30fps)
   - Audio narration synthesis
4. FFmpeg assembly with precise synchronization
5. Quality verification and delivery

## Performance Optimization
- Batch image generation for 3x throughput
- Aggressive caching of common educational elements
- Multithreaded frame interpolation
